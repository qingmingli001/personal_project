      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Date: October 9th 2020; Author: Qingming Li</p>
      <p>My name is Qingming Li, and I come from China. You guys can call me MING as all of my friends.</p>

      <p>I always think that the technology of the Internet and software has brought so much convenience to our daily life in all aspects. For instance, we can make transactions via online banking without the need to go to the bank, and we can go shopping online whenever and wherever we want. Then, an idea comes to my mind. It must be awesome if I can develop software that can be used in practice and change the lifestyle of folks. Therefore, I have chosen this major.</p>
      <p>I have grown up in Xi'an Shaanxi province in China. Xi'an is located in the central area of China and has a long historical background. The most famous and world-known tourist attraction is the Xi'an Terracotta Warriors Museum. The terracotta warriors are life-sized, and they vary in height, uniform, and hairstyle. Each of them is unique and different from others. The terracotta warriors not only hold the huge value of art, but they also represent the life of ancient China about 2000 years ago. It really worth your presenting, if you have opportunity to travel to China.</p>

      <p>Obviously, my passion lies in becoming a successful software developer, and I will devote my time and energy into it.</p>
      <p>In addition, I am a big fan of skiing, and I have experienced several seasons. My friends ever told me Winnipeg would be my place because it has a long winter period. So, I am really hoping anyone of you guys who is into skiing or snowboarding would join me this winter. I am now expecting it will snow soon.</p>
      <p>Actually, I also love other kinds of extreme sports. For example, I achieved my scuba-diving license last year. I love challenging myself, and it would be wonderful to explore new adventures with you guys in Winnipeg.</p>
